# Purpose

## Background

I do weight / resistance training several times per week. Each time that I do it, I have a specific workout routine that I follow. As I continue working out from week to week, I would like to be able to record the progress that I am making for each exercise. I would also like to be able to visualize the progress that I am making over time.

## Solution

This application allows a user to:

1. Create a workout
  - A list of exercises to be performed
  - A specific weight (or body weight) to use for the exercise
  - A target number of reps per exercise (set)
  - A target number of rounds for the total exercise sequence

2. Record performance during workout
  1. Signal rep start (user exercises)
  2. Record reps (after exercise)
  3. Rest timer counts down (while reps entered)
  4. Time completes, repeat step 1 until completed

3. Visualize workout performance & progress
  - View last workout results
  - For a given exercise, view line graph of progress (reps, weight, volume) over time
